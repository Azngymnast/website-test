<h2>Solo Bouldering:</h2>
<p>Solo bouldering is good for you. It teaches things like beta reading for your style/box/span, it strengthens mental fortitude by forcing one to think about self preservation through sketchy topouts and commiting moves which also necessitates one to learn how to minimally pad a problem. </p>
<br>

<h2>The process:</h2>
<p>Its more fun and more rewarding doing and accomplishing things the hard way. Stay focused and enjoy the process</p>

<h2>Sign Spinners:</h2>
<p>sign spinners are the purest most ultimate form of advertising. Using your own body and its movement to advertise something is pretty fucking punk rock. Go tip your nearest sign spinner because they are busting to no real audience.</p>
